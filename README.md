This repository delves into advanced SQL concepts that can enhance your database interactions for assignments. Explore these techniques to streamline data manipulation, improve efficiency, and add robustness to your solutions.

1. Table Constraints:

    What: Define rules that ensure data integrity in your tables. Think of them as safeguards that prevent invalid or unexpected data entry.
    Types:
        NOT NULL: Guarantees a column holds a value (not null).
        UNIQUE: Enforces no duplicate values within a specified column(s).
        PRIMARY KEY: A unique identifier for each row in a table (only one per table).
        FOREIGN KEY: Creates a relationship between tables, referencing a PRIMARY KEY in another table.
        CHECK: Enforces specific conditions beyond data types (e.g., email format validation).

2. Query Optimization with Indexes:

    What: Indexes function like signposts in a book, speeding up data retrieval. They allow efficient filtering and sorting of large datasets.
    How: Indexes create sorted structures based on specific columns, enabling faster searches compared to scanning the entire table.
    Creation: Define indexes within the CREATE TABLE statement using INDEX or KEY keywords, or add them later using ALTER TABLE.

3. Stored Procedures and Functions:

    Stored Procedures: Predefined blocks of SQL statements for complex operations. They promote code reusability and enhance security.
    Stored Functions: Similar to procedures, but return a single value. Useful for calculations, data transformations, and validations.
    Creation: Use CREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION statements, respectively.

4. Views in MySQL:

    What: Virtual tables based on a predefined SQL query. They offer a simplified view of underlying tables, hiding complexity and potentially sensitive data.
    Creation: Use the CREATE VIEW statement.

5. Triggers in MySQL:

    What: Triggers are special database objects that automatically execute specific actions (usually SQL statements) in response to events like INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE on a table.
    Types:
        BEFORE: Executes before the triggering event.
        AFTER: Executes after the triggering event.
        FOR EACH ROW: Executes for each affected row in the triggering event.
    Creation: Use the CREATE TRIGGER statement.
